When we are talking about development builds, I could use a magic command in the terminal that would start a small web server that we could use for development purposes.

Generally, it would be a great idea to have something like that for running our application in production mode as well.

The bad news is that it's not recommended to use web pack disorder for production because it's not optimized for such use cases.

However, the good news is that we can create our own web server using express framework and then use this web server for running our application in production mode.
